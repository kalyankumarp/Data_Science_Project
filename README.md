Data Wrangling, and Exploratory Data Analysis
•	The objective of this project is to build best regression, classification and clustering models and to predict the Democratic and Republican votes for counties of a dataset using the best regression models.
•	Performed Data Preparation using Pandas to find any missing values and to transform raw data into tidy data i.e. transformed long format to wide format and merged the two datasets into a single dataset appropriate for data analysis.
•	Explored the data using Seaborn libraries and removed the attributes that are irrelevant, redundant and that have many missing values.
